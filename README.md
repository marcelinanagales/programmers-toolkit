# programmers-toolkit
To take all programming work from undergrad &amp; grad years and form a 
database of code. Mostly to help prepare for tests

# Additional Details
This repository will include Monte Carlo Methods, ACS I, ACS II and various 
other resources from undergrad (if I can find them). In doing my homework 
for Spring 2018 (second semester of graduate school), I found that it was 
easier to have previous work that I needed here so that it was accessible 
from any laptop or computer. 

### Armadillo (C++) 
* armatest.cpp - new code to test (not included in example1.cpp)
* armatestdoc.txt - compile and run code for armatest.cpp
* example1.cpp - code from armadillo documentation
* lab6doc.txt - compile, how to run from terminal (documentation for lab 6)
* lab6_nagalesacsii.cpp - code using armadillo for ACS II (spring 2018)

### Bayesian + MCM (Python)
* Lab 4_MCM.ipynb - answer for MetaStudyAnalysis Lab 
* Lab 4_MCM.pdf - pdf version of .ipynb 
* MetaStudyAnalysis_Lab-1.pdf - initial assignment write up
* Metropolis_LEC.pdf - notes from class that helped with implementation

### Fourier Series (C++)
* example2.cpp - needed code for ACS II assignment: subset of fftw3_prb.c
* fftw3_prb.cpp - John Burkardt's test code for fourier analysis 

### Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Python)
* Homework 4- MCM.ipynb - markov chain monte carlo done in Python notebook
* Homework 4- MCM.pdf - pdf version of the document above
* hw.pdf - original assignment

### Newton's Method (C++)
* lab3_nagalesascii.cpp - second implementation of Newtons method with Armadillo
  (ACS II)

### OpenMP (C++)
* nagales_hw10.cpp - code from Scientific Programming (Fall 2017) 
* OpenMP3.0-SummarySpec.pdf - helpful commands (only for some mpi versions)
* README.txt - compile instructions for nagales_hw10.cpp

### x Dissertation Tips
* time-management-tips.pdf - from UNC Chapel Hill History Department
