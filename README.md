# programmers-toolkit
To take all programming work from undergrad &amp; grad years and form a 
database of code. Mostly to help prepare for tests

### Additional Details
This repository will include Monte Carlo Methods, ACS I, ACS II and various 
other resources from undergrad (if I can find them). In doing my homework 
for Spring 2018 (second semester of graduate school), I found that it was 
easier to have previous work that I needed here so that it was accessible 
from any laptop or computer. 

# Armadillo (C++)
* example1.cpp - code from armadillo documentation
* lab6_nagalesacsii.cpp - code using armadillo for ACS II (spring 2018)
* README (copy).txt - compile, how to run from terminal 

# Fourier Series

# Markov Chain Monte Carlo
